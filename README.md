This workshop uses disease mapping methods and data from the R package SpatialEpi to estimate lung cancer risk in Pennsylvania, United States. This tutorial also shows how to calculate the observed and expected disease cases and the Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) in each of the Pennsylvania counties as well as how to obtain disease risk estimates and quantify risk factors using INLA. Finally, it shows how to make interactive maps of the disease risk estimates using `leaflet`.
